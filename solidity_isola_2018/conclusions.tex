\section{Conclusion}
\label{section:conclusion}
We have presented our current work and future plans building an SMT-based
formal verification module inside the Solidity compiler.
%
The module creates SMT constraints from the Solidity code and queries SMT
solvers to statically check for underflow/overflow, division by zero,
unreachable/trivial code, and assertion fails, where require statements are
used as assumptions.
%
The programmer receives, in compile-time, feedback with counterexamples in case
any of the target properties fail, without any extra effort.
%
The SMT constraints and queries are created using theories that model the
Solidity program precisely, therefore the given counterexamples are correct.

The features that are currently under implementation aim at extending the
subset of Solidity that is supported, as well as improving error reporting.
%
Future work on the SMT module includes interesting broader research questions,
such as computing multi-transaction invariants for state variables, detecting
post-constructor invariants, and using modifier-based abstraction for
functions.
