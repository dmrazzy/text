\section{Conclusion}
\label{section:conclusion}
We have presented our work in progress building an SMT-based formal
verification module inside the Solidity compiler.
%
The component creates SMT constraints from the Solidity code and queries to
statically check for underflow/overflow, division by zero, unreachable/trivial
code, and assertion fails.
%
The programmer receives, in compile-time, feedback with counterexamples in case
any of the target properties fail, without any extra effort.

Our under implementation features intend to extend the subset of Solidity that
is supported, and future work includes interesting research questions, such as
computing multi-transaction invariants for state variables, and using
properties from assertions at the end of functions or from modifiers to compute
generic invariants, as discussed in Sec.~\ref{section:smt}.
