\begin{abstract}
Ethereum smart contracts are programs that run inside a public distributed
database called a blockchain.  These smart contracts are used to handle tokens
of value, can be accessed and analyzed by everyone and are immutable once
deployed.
%
Those characteristics make it imperative that smart contracts are bug-free at
deployment time, hence the need to verify them formally.
%
In this paper we describe our current efforts in building an SMT-based formal
verification module within the compiler of Solidity, a popular language for
writing smart contracts.
%
The tool is seamlessly integrated into the compiler, where during compilation,
the user is automatically warned of and given counterexamples for potential
arithmetic overflow/underflow, unreachable code, trivial conditions, and
assertion fails.
%
We present how the component currently translates a subset of Solidity into SMT
statements using different theories, and discuss future challenges such as
multi-transaction and state invariants.
